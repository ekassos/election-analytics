# Weekly Updates
## [Week 1: Uncovering Swing States](https://ekassos.github.io/election-analytics/week-1.html)
_Before taking a deep dive into election result predictions, I thought it would be of great interest to investigate some of the parallel universes, or contributing factors if you would like, of election night results. This week, we look at swing states and how we can identify those based on historical trends, and investigate the effect of turnout to the popular vote results._

## [Week 2: Pennies and Quarters](https://ekassos.github.io/election-analytics/week-2.html)
_This week, we start creating our election prediction model by comparing economy data with popular vote results. In particular, we will make and compare a national popular vote prediction model based on the second or third-quarter GDP growth percentage of election years._

## [Week 3 - Grading Election Polls](https://ekassos.github.io/election-analytics/week-3.html)
_This week, we make a new prediction model by comparing FiveThirtyEight's election poll rankings. In particular, we will make a national popular vote prediction model based on the scaled results of each poll, influenced by FiveThirtyEight's election poll rankings._

## [Week 4 - Trump and Incumbency](https://ekassos.github.io/election-analytics/week-4.html)
_This week, we make a new linear regression prediction model based on the GDP Quarter Growth we saw in Week 2, and the net approval rating for each incumbent party candidate and use those to predict the popular vote share._
